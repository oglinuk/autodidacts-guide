# Autodidacts Guide

A guide by autodidacts, for autodidacts. This guide (or book) is written
entirely in (CommonMark) markdown, and continually updated. To allow this
book to be distributed in various formats, including physical, all
references will be defined at the bottom of each section. Each reference
will have an associated number, and the number will follow at the end of
any applicable reference points (see licenses below). This guide also
assumes that you have an editor to write code in, and a terminal to run
commands. Every section that has associated code, also has an
accompanying Docker container, but the container is not required to be
used. Remember not to just read, but to apply the write and execute parts
of the rwx method when working through this guide.
